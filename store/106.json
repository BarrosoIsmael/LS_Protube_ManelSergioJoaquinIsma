To match our experience, cameras have to do this, too, \"balancing\" the colors of an image so that a white object looks white under a given light, rather than some other color. And the typical unit to measure the color of a light is the Kelvin. Which is weird, because Kelvin is a unit  for measuring temperature, not color. What temperature and the color in a photograph have to do with each other comes down to history and physics.\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\r\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\r\n\r\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\r\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\r\n\r\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\r\n\r\nCreated by Henry Reich", "categories": ["Science & Technology"], "tags": ["physics", "minutephysics", "science"], "comments": [{"text": "who is kelvin", "author": "redteayoutube"}, {"text": "This Channel is our family favorite.", "author": "mattkampoeng"}]}}
