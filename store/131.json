It was here before me and will be long here long after I am gone.  It kind of reminds me of the Winchester Mystery House in California in that both dont make a lot of sense in construction or reason and seems a bit more of a hodgepodge but that doesn't mean it isn't crafted beautifully. I realize that this craftsmanship costs money...It truly the ugliest and most beautiful church in the world.", "author": "CHAOTICREATIONS"}, {"text": "First visit was 2011, church is unbelievable inside and out.
