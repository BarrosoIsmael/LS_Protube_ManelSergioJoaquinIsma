Box 30921 New York, NY 10011\n\nLYRICS:\nWatching Game of Thrones I haven't left home\nTold everyone that I had the flu\nIt's an obsession I'm filled with depression\ncus it's the end of season two\nNow, my, friends all tell me that I've lost my grip on reality\nThey tell me it's just a nerd show, but Dragons are real to me\nSome day those dragons will be grown\nDaenerys will be my queen\nand when we reclaim the throne you\nwon't be allowed in our house\nDon't call me at nine\nOn a Sunday Night\nI don't care who died\nI'm filling my mind with sword fights, and quests, horse lord, and incest. When Ned died I cried\nWatching Game of Thrones its like a black hole\nWanna kill Joffrey with his own shoes\nMagical kingdoms with naked women\nand none of them have silicon boobs\nAnd If the seven kingdoms did exist\nI would drink and party with that imp\nViserys had gold poured onto his head\nHe's no fucking dragon now he's dead\nOuch\nI'll sick my dierwolf on ya\nIf you get in my way\nHe's actually a chihuahua\nBut he'll still rip off your face\nI only leave my apartment\nto put the rent in the mail\nThat's right I still pay my bills cus\nLannister's repay their debts\nI'm joining the Knights Watch It's my birthright\nI'll stand watch for WhiteWalkers in the snow. \nThis Wall kind of blows\nNo hot chicks, just bros and old crusty guys\nWatching Game of Thrones\nI feel bad for John Snow\nIt seems like he's always getting screwed\nGave up on Mad Men cus nothing happens except for when Don's wife sang Zou bisou\nThe Lannisters all look like Surfer dicks\nJamie banged his sister she's a bitch\nNo one knows that King Joeffrey's their kid\nExcept for maybe Peter Dinklage\nthis is best role\nRAP:\nThis is nothing but nerd shit\nYou better get a damned grip and go outside and get some fresh air\nGet your fat butt un-stuck from the chair ain't a dragon slayer just a loser in your underwear Wait a second did I just see a pair boobs\nIf you don't mind I'm gonna chill for a few with you\nDude, why is that girl pretending she a boy yo?\nOh shit that witch just give birth to a cloud of smoke!\nHow'd that hot naked blond chick survive the fire\nIsn't Mayor Carcetti from the Wire\nI apologize for being so shitty before\nThis show is Lord of the Rings but with titties galore\nBut I'm sure who I'm supposed to root for\nI like Rob Stark but I like the dwarf more\nCall my manager and cancel my tour I gotta read A Storm of Swords\nOh Theon Greyjoy you were a nice boy\ntil you had those two kids barbequed\nWinter Is coming I'm not sure what that means but you can bet it's probably bad news\nI'm not playing music anymore\nFrom now on you can just be Maroon 4\nNext time they do they The Voice I won't be there\nTell Ceelo his cat can have my chair\nCus I'm stuck in Game of Thrones", "categories": ["Entertainment"], "tags": ["Barely Guys", "Barely Political", "Rated Awesome", "Key Of Awesome", "The Key Of Awesome Parodies", "Todd Womack", "Super Therapy", "Mark Douglas", "The Very Best Of Barely"], "comments": [{"text": "This remains a certified classic.
