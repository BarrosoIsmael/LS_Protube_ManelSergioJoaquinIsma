The skin has an added card pocket that comes in handy for the times when I may not want to carry both a phone and a wallet. Cell phone cases are just another place that can be a blank canvas for custom leather work. I hope you enjoy the video and get inspired to customize your own case.\n\nWhat is the Gospel? \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmKZJx5AlWY&t=37s\n\nCheck out my work on my Instagram account .\nFollow me at: \ud83d\udc47\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kingdomgloryleather/\n\nMusic from Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\nhttps://uppbeat.io/t/northwestern/all-i-need\nLicense code: BTO6MJGXTVRQU4ES\n\nMusic from Uppbeat (free for Creators!):\nhttps://uppbeat.io/t/northwestern/piece-by-piece\nLicense code: OFMU1NTI1XK33UJY", "categories": ["Howto & Style"], "tags": ["How to make a leather cell phone case", "Leather case", "Leather phone skin", "Leather craft", "Leathercraft", "Leather phone case", "Leather cell phone case", "How to tool leather", "How to stamp leather", "How to make leather", "How to stitch leather", "Saddle stitching", "Iphone", "iPhone case", "Cell phone", "Cell phone case", "Custom phone case", "Apple", "Apple iphone", "Apple iphone case"], "comments": [{"text": "What is the Gospel?\n\ud83d\udc49https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmKZJx5AlWY&t=37s\ud83d\udc48", "author": "KingdomGloryLeather"}, {"text": "Praise the Lord, \nWatching from Nepal", "author": "santoshtamang1085"}, {"text": "Glory leather is paying for likes", "author": "niharikareddy9781"}, {"text": "THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA AND GREAT VIDEO", "author": "artsylady3187"}]}}
