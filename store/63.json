I have the pleasure of providing the official lyric video for DJ Snake & Justin Bieber's track \"Let Me Love You\". Personally I don't know if I like Cold Water or Let Me Love You more but they are both incredible. Hope you enjoy. :)\n\nStream \"Encore\" on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/EncoreDJSnake.sp\n\n\u2022DJ Snake:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/djsnake\nhttp://www.facebook.com/djsnake.fr\nhttp://www.twitter.com/djsnake\n\n\u2022Justin Bieber:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/\nhttps://twitter.com/justinbieber\nhttp://www.justinbiebermusic.com/\n\nLyric video by: http://Incept.online\n\nIf you'd like to submit a picture, you can send it here:\nhttp://pandoric.com/contact\n\nUse the new template if you would like to submit a picture! :)\nhttp://goo.gl/yoEGNg", "categories": ["Entertainment"], "tags": ["Proximity", "DJ Snake", "Justin Bieber", "Let Me Love You", "Lyric Video", "DJ Snake Let Me Love You", "Justin Bieber Let Me Love You", "Official", "Dj Snake Justin Bieber", "DJ Snake Justin Bieber Let Me Love You", "LMLY", "DJ Snake LMLY", "Justin Bieber LMLY", "Never Let You Go", "Don't You Give Up", "Nah Nah Nah", "Let Me Love You Lyric Video", "LMLY Lyric Video", "DJ Snake lyric video", "justin bieber lyric video", "Encore", "DJ Snake Encore", "Justin Bieber lyric video", "Justin bieber let me love you lyric video", "EDM"], "comments": [{"text": "1 BILLION VIEWS!
