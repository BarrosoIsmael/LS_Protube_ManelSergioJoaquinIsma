listening to the sound of my tears\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI get a little bit nervous\nThat the best of all the years have gone by\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then I get a little bit terrified\nAnd then I see the look in your eyes\n\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\nEvery now and then I fall apart\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\nEvery now and then\nI fall apart\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI get a little bit restless\nAnd I dream of something wild\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI get a little bit helpless\nAnd I'm lying like a child in your arms\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI get a little bit angry\nAnd I know I've got to get out and cry\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI get a little bit terrified\nBut then I see the look in your eyes\n\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\nEvery now and then\nI fall apart\nTurn around, bright eyes\nEvery now and then\nI fall apart\n\nAnd I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong\n\nTogether we can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)\n\nI don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark\nWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks\n\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n(Forever's gonna start tonight)\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nThere's nothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\n\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\n\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI know you'll never be the boy\nYou always wanted to be\n\n(Turn around)\nBut every now and then\nI know you'll always be the only boy\nWho wanted me the way that I am\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI know there's no one in the universe\nAs magical and wondrous as you\n\n(Turn around)\nEvery now and then\nI know there's nothing any better\nThere's nothing that I just wouldn't do\n\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\nEvery now and then I fall apart\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\nEvery now and then I fall apart\n\nAnd I need you now tonight\nAnd I need you more than ever\nAnd if you only hold me tight\nWe'll be holding on forever\nAnd we'll only be making it right\n'Cause we'll never be wrong\n\nTogether we can take it to the end of the line\nYour love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)\n\nI don't know what to do\nI'm always in the dark\nLiving in a powder keg and giving off sparks\n\nI really need you tonight\nForever's gonna start tonight\n(Forever's gonna start tonight)\n\nOnce upon a time I was falling in love\nBut now I'm only falling apart\nThere's nothing I can do\nA total eclipse of the heart\n\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\nBut now there's only love in the dark\nNothing I can say\nA total eclipse of the heart\n\nA total eclipse of the heart\nA total eclipse of the heart\n\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\n(Turn around, bright eyes)\n(Turn around)", "categories": ["Music"], "tags": ["Bonnie Tyler Total Eclipse of the Heart", "Total Eclipse of the Heart official video", "Bonnie Tyler Total Eclipse of the Heart official
